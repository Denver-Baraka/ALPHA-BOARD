## 1. Hello world
just some testing of all the leds on the board. have them light up in order. something like a traffic lights
## 2. Scroller
Like scrolling through the Leds using the buttons, either up scroll or down scroll
## 3. My room is cool
Monitor room temperature and show status. green = ok, yellow = getting hot, red = too hot. too hot buzzer alarm goes on.
## 4. Mood light
Ambient light levels based on current light levels. green = dark sorrounding(cozy lighting), yellow = medium light, red =  bright sorroundings
## 5. Wish you success
play some notes. vary frequency and pitch with the pots. also how the LEDs light up
